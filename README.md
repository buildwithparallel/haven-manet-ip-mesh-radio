## Haven MANET IP Mesh Radio

This repository is for notes, guides, and experiments around building a **Haven-style MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network) IP mesh radio** setup.

At the moment it is mostly text documentation and rough notes that will grow over time into more structured guides and, potentially, scripts and configs.

---

### Contents

- `general.txt` – general notes and ideas (currently a placeholder).
- `haven-gate.txt` – planned notes for gateway nodes (uplink / bridge nodes).
- `haven-point.txt` – planned notes for point / edge nodes.
- `rnode-guide.txt` – planned notes and references for RNode / Reticulum.
- `Reticulum/` – placeholder for Reticulum-related files (configs, docs, or code).

As you add more content, you can update these descriptions to match reality.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/haven-manet-ip-mesh-radio.git
cd haven-manet-ip-mesh-radio
```

Then open the `.txt` files in your editor of choice and start filling out the documentation.

---

### Roadmap Ideas

- Flesh out the text guides into clear step-by-step instructions.
- Add example Reticulum configuration files and node layouts.
- Document hardware setups (e.g. radios, SBCs, power).
- Optionally add scripts or automation for common tasks.
