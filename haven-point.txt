# Haven Point (Blue)

## Node Details
- IP: 10.41.73.196
- SSH: root / blue
- WiFi AP: 5GHz on phy1-ap0
- Mesh: 802.11ah HaLow on wlan0 (ESSID: "haven")

## Fix: Missing Default Gateway (2026-02-09)

5GHz clients couldn't reach internet - no default route was configured.

### Solution
```bash
uci set network.ahwlan.gateway="10.41.0.1"
uci commit network
```

Traffic flow: 5GHz Clients -> Blue -> HaLow mesh -> Green (10.41.0.1) -> Internet
